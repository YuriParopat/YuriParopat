This repository contains the solution using software written in C++ to solve mathematical equations.
The study to generate this report generated an article titled: Study of Stacks and How It Can Be Used as a Tool to Solve Parent Equations with Unpredictable Depths (Estudo de pilhas e como ela pode ser usada como ferramenta para resolver equaÃ§Ãµes parentesadas com profundidades imprevisÃ­veis).

<h3 align="left">The article summary is: </h3>
<p> A stack is one of the most well-known problem structure features, as simpler types like vectors and matrices are not capable of solving. A new value is added to the stack or just at its top. This feature helps to solve problems of unpredictable depth, as is the case with the object of this study: a completely related expression. This article carries out the study and implementation of a stack with Abstract Data Type, the push and pop method abstraction. It is also relevant in this study to study the infix and post-fix notations, firstly are different ways of representing the same expression. It is necessary indicate to the computer the order of execution and of the operations contained in the delivery. The stack, in turn, stores a number of steps that can grow unpredictably and perform the built-in operations.</p>
